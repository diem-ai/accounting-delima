* The idea is to find a subset populated from a BigDecial array which is created from a input text file.
* Searching will be terminated if subtraction between given value and each item in subset is zero.
* The explanation can be found more detail in comments at the head of java classes.
* Main class is ValidationTest.java 
* To execute find-payments.jar:
Go to console windows -> cd to /AccountingDelima -> perform command: java -jar find_payments.jar <text file name>
